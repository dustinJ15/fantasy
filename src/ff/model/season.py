"""Rest-of-season lineup value, week by week.

`lineup_strength` prices a roster as one rest-of-season lineup over availability-weighted averages, which is how a QB on
IR for a month read as 55% of a weekly starter and nobody's slot ever went empty. Here each remaining week gets its
own greedy lineup: a player is worth his per-game number in the weeks he plays, nothing on his bye and nothing until
he is back, and the best free agent at each position sits in the pool as the body the wire would supply, so the cost
of shipping a man's only QB is the gap to the QB he could pick up, not zero and not infinity. Weeks are weighted by
`week_weight` (1 in the regular season; in the fantasy playoffs, the team's playoff odds times `TITLE_RUN_MULT`, so a
dead team prices a week-16 bye at nothing and a lock prices it above a regular week; `injuries.week_weights` is the
same number), and the result is in points per week so nothing downstream changes units.
