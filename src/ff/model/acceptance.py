"""Would he say yes? A transparent scorecard, not a classifier.

A trade only has value if the rival accepts it, and the lineup delta the scan computes with my projections is a number
he never sees. What he sees: the chart he opens (taxed for an uneven package), whether he gets the best player, whether
the piece starts for him, what he is left with at the slot, whether he has to cut a body, his own app's grade of the
incoming player, and whether he is the kind of manager who trades at all. Each term is a factor with a one-line reason
the row can print; the product, clamped, is `p_accept`. The starting values come from the research in
docs/research/trade-acceptance.md and are meant to be tuned against the outcome log, not believed to two decimals.
