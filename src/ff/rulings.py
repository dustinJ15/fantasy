"""Memory for Claude's `skip` rulings on trade rows, so a package Dustin passed on does not come back every morning.

The scan re-derives the same offers daily from the same rosters; the only state it had was ESPN's pending list.
`ff render-email` records each skipped trade row here; `packet.build` drops candidates skipped in the last
`SKIP_DAYS`. The file lives under data/projlog, which the routine already pushes to the `projlog` branch and
`scripts/cloud_setup.sh` restores on the next clone. A rival roster change that makes the package different (a new
`get` set) is a new row and is not skipped.
